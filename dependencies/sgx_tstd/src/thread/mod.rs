/// another thread by calling the [`unpark`] method on the blocked thread's
/// handle.
///
/// Conceptually, each [`Thread`] handle has an associated token, which is
/// initially not present:
///
/// * The [`thread::park`][`park`] function blocks the current thread unless or
///   until the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it
///   atomically consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without
///   consuming the token. [`thread::park_timeout`] does the same, but allows
///   specifying a maximum time to block the thread for.
///
/// * The [`unpark`] method on a [`Thread`] atomically makes the token available
///   if it wasn't already. Because the token is initially absent, [`unpark`]
///   followed by [`park`] will result in the second call returning immediately.
///
/// In other words, each [`Thread`] acts a bit like a spinlock that can be
/// locked and unlocked using `park` and `unpark`.
///
/// The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
/// placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
/// find it, and then `park`ing in a loop. When some desired condition is met, another
/// thread calls [`unpark`] on the handle.
///
/// The motivation for this design is twofold:
///
/// * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
///   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic
///   blocking/signaling.
///
/// * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.
